<h1>Examples for Schnorr Signature Library</h1><p>This folder contains examples for the Schnorr Signature library. The library provides an implementation of the Schnorr signature scheme on the secp256k1 curve, the same curve used by Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p><p>The examples are written in Solidity and can be executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine using Remix, Truffle, or any other Ethereum development tool. Each example is provided as a standalone Solidity file and demonstrates a specific use case of the Schnorr signature scheme.</p><h2>Example files</h2><p>The following example files are included in this folder:</p><ul><li><p><code>example1.sol</code>: Shows how to generate a key pair, sign a message using the key pair, and verify the signature.</p></li><li><p><code>example2.sol</code>: Demonstrates how to verify a Schnorr signature generated outside of the contract using the public key.</p></li><li><p><code>example3.sol</code>: Shows how to generate a new key pair on-chain and use it to sign a message.</p></li><li><p><code>example4.sol</code>: Demonstrates how to use the Schnorr signature scheme to implement a multi-signature contract.</p></li><li><p><code>example5.sol</code>: Shows how to use the Schnorr signature scheme for confidential transactions.</p></li></ul><h2>Usage</h2><p>To run the examples, you can copy the code into an Ethereum development tool, such as Remix or Truffle, and deploy the contract on a local or public Ethereum network. You can also run the examples using the Solidity compiler and a local Ethereum client such as Ganache.</p><p>The examples can be executed in any order and do not depend on each other. Simply deploy the contract and call the function you want to test using Remix or a custom script.</p><h2>License</h2><p>This code is released under the MIT License.</p></div>
