# Solidity-Schnorr

This is a Solidity implementation of the Schnorr signature algorithm. Schnorr signatures are a type of digital signature that provides a high level of security and privacy. They were first proposed in the 1990s, and are currently being considered for inclusion in the Bitcoin protocol as a replacement for the current ECDSA signature scheme.

This library provides functions for key pair generation, signature generation, and signature verification. It also includes several utility functions for elliptic curve arithmetic and hashing. The library is implemented using the secp256k1 elliptic curve, which is the same curve used in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

This library is intended for use in smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, but can also be used in standalone applications that require Schnorr signature functionality. The library is written in Solidity version 0.8.0 and has been thoroughly tested with Truffle and Ganache.

Please note that while this library has been carefully designed and tested, it is not guaranteed to be free from errors or vulnerabilities. Use at your own risk, and always review the code carefully before using it in a production environment.
